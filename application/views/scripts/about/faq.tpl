      Your membership dues for the team will cost $45 for your first semester on the team, in subsequent semesters they will be $55. The membership fee is the only expense for beginners and covers all the lessons, practices and club membership. If you are on the A, B, C or Pre-C team you are also responsible for additional lesson fees (see &quot;A, B, C and Pre-C lesson fees and subsidizations&quot; below).</div>

      The money you pay for A, B,  C and Pre-C lessons goes directly towards paying for your lessons. The membership dues are used to cover the expense for renting the CCRB (over $1000/ semester) and subsidizing the lessons for the beginners (fully) and A, B,  C and Pre-C team members (partially).</div>

                          <div align="left" class="style3"><a name="SpringSummer"></a><em><strong>What happens during the spring and summer terms?</strong></em><br>

      During the spring/summer the team does not collect membership fees. Because membership fees are not collected the summer general and advanced lessons are not subsidized. In this case, the cost of the class is split evenly between all participants (usually between $5-7 for a 2-hour general class). You pay for only those classes which you can attend, although you may be required to give advanced notice of your attendance (usually less than one week) and if you do not show up but said you would then you will be charged for that lesson. Two types of lessons are offered during the spring and summer terms:<br>

      <br>

      Spring/Summer General Lessons- Are open to everybody. These classes cover basic technique and do not require a partner.<br>

      <br>

      Spring/Summer Advanced Lessons- Are open to anybody who was on the A or B team within the last semester. It is strongly encouraged for you to have a partner in these classes.</div>

                        </li>

                        <li>

                          <div align="left" class="style3"><a name="RegulationsABC"></a><em><strong>What are the regulations about A, B,  C, and Pre-C lesson fees and subsidizations?</strong></em><br>

      The charge for all lessons taking place at the Steve &amp; Susan's Studio is $80/hour. The A, B and C teams, who usually have 4 lesson-hours per week, are each subsidized by the team for 1.5/4 hours and the remainder 2.5/4 hours is split evenly between teammates. The Pre-C team usually have 2 lesson-hours per week. Dues are typically collected on a monthly basis. Beginners are fully subsidized and have to only pay for membership.<br>

      <br>

      If you are on the A, B, C or Pre-C team you are responsible for paying for all lessons during a payment period (one month), even those you can not attend. This is to keep the price for everyone in the class low and predictable. If you will be gone for a full payment period and notify the treasurer TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE before the month that you will not be attending lessons, then you will not be charged for the lessons during that month/payment period. Also, if you decide to quit the team or to stop attending lessons for the rest of the semester then you will not be charged anymore when you stop taking classes, as long as you notify the treasurer (TWO WEEKS ADVANCE NOTICE) of your leaving.</div>

                        </li>

                          <div align="left" class="style3"><a name="Canellations"></a><em><strong>What is policy about lesson scheduling and cancellations?</strong></em><br>

      A lesson will be kept if there are a minimum of 5 couples willing to attend the lesson. If this minimum is not reached then the class may be cancelled. Additional lessons may also be scheduled during breaks or holidays if this minimum interest is met.</div>

                        </li>
